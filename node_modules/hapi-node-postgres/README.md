We use the [`pg`](https://github.com/brianc/node-postgres) (`node-postgres`)
module and take advantage of its connection pooling feature.

Note: Your project should have its own `pg` dependency installed. We depend on
`pg` via `peerDependencies`. If you elect to use native bindings you'll also
need to install the `pg-native` package.


## Install

```bash
$ npm install hapi-node-postgres
```


## Usage

In your request handlers you'll have access to `request.pg.client` which you
can use to make DB requests. We even clean up the connection for you after the
request is complete.

During your request handler you can set `request.pg.kill` to `true`, and we'll
remove the connection from the pool instead of simply returning it to be
reused. This is usually done when an error is detected during a query.


#### Register the plugin manually.

```js
const plugin = {
    register: require('hapi-node-postgres'),
    options: {
        connectionString: 'postgres://username:password@localhost/database',
        native: true
    }
};

server.register(plugin, (err) => {

    if (err) {
        console.error('Failed loading "hapi-node-postgres" plugin');
    }
 });
```

#### Or include it in your composer manifest.

```json
"plugins": {
    "hapi-node-postgres": {
        "connectionString": "postgres://username:password@localhost/database",
        "native": true
    }
}
```

The options passed to the plugin is an object where:

 - `connectionString` - a string representing the connection details for
    Postgres.
 - `attach` - a string representing the extension point event where the
    request is decorated with the `pg` attribute. Defaults to `onPreHandler`.
 - `detach` - a string representing the server event where the connection is
    cleaned up. Defaults to `tail`.
 - `native` - a boolean indicating if the native bindings should be used.
    Defaults to `false`. [Native bindings offer 20-30% increase in parsing
    speed.](https://github.com/brianc/node-postgres#native-bindings)

events.](http://hapijs.com/api/#request-lifecycle)

## Don't forget

What you create with `hapi-node-postgres` is more important than `hapi-node-postgres`.
